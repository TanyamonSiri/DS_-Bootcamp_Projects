In data science bootcamp with 4 months intensive program (15 Dec 2022 - 30 June 2023), we've learnt 10 sprints (on-going) which are in-demand skills to be an Entry-level Data Analyst. Therefore, all my consistent homework and projects are as follows:

## 1. Spreadsheet



* [Dynamic Query](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/DynamicQuery.jpg)
* [Converting TH to ENG Date](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/Convert_TH_to_EN_Date.jpg)
* [ID Card Parser](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/IDCardParser.jpg)



## 2. Database SQL 
A simple restaurant database created with `SQL` consists of 5 dimension tables and 1 fact table, as well as an ER-diagram and some queries for data analysis. This project is published in [Replit](https://replit.com/~), which is a powerful platform for creating and sharing software. I also create the ER-diagram of my restaurant database to show the relationships between tables available in this database.

## 3. R Programming
The Rule-based Chatbot is created to assist users in choosing Thai food üçΩÔ∏è and playing an interactive rock-paper-scissors game üïπÔ∏è. This project is created with `R` and published in Replit, with an objective to manage input data using control flow and function to provide pre-defined replies.

## 4. Data Transformation with R
Using the `rvest` package to scrape data from two different web page (IMDb & VLR.gg), along with regular expression and `dplyr` package to transform it into usable format.

* [Source Code](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Transformation/Data_Transformation_Web_Scraping.r)

## 5. Data Visualization with R
A report with 5 visualization from `diamonds` dataset, using `ggplot2` to explore this dataset and create `R Markdown` document. Note that
`diamonds` is a built-in dataset in ggplot2 library that containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 round cut diamonds.

## 6. Statistics

## 7. Machine Learning for Data Analyst

## 8. Intro to Python Programming

## 9. Essential Python for Data Science
Use `request` to get data from [the Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api)üçπ which is a public API and export to .csv file. Along with use `sklearn` algorithms to build 3 machine learning models which are LinearRegression, RandomForest and DecisionTree.
